Came down to a house where I grew up in my teenage and adoloscent years. Memories rushing back from school and the time I spent in this house. I am here to be a caregiver for a person who has undergone a surgery.</p>

<p>Today seems to be generally a better day for me. Spent big part of it reflecting as to why do I operate in these cycles of hope and despair. This need for being loved and being free. Need for Solitude and detestation of lonliness. All this time the choices have always been with me and I have made them and then I have gone back to question them. Then why do I feel this lack of control? It just seems to be a perpetual cycle, like everything else in nature.</p>

<p>I was just flipping through old letters and reading the eternal promises of friendship I and she made, that seem to mean nothing now. One bound by resolution and other one by a strong sense of boundaries. Prioritising what is important to self than the other, possibly in both the cases.</p>

<p>If she put me to a test on this, what would I do? I have wondered. I am thinking about that and reflecting back on the letter I wrote to her few days back. Atleast the last part of it. Here is the paraphrased version of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I miss you. I am extremely sorry to have hurt you. I know I did. It is unforgivable and I understand that. Yet, I don’t think I will reach out and apologise. Apology has no meaning without amends. And I have no way or intention of making amends. I miss you because you were closest to someone I meaningfully loved in a long time. I could tell you everything. And I miss our conversation but I don’t miss the complexity of our lives. I feel free but also lonely. This is acceptable to me, on most days. Just that today is not that day. 
This is a very very selfish <i>I miss you</i>. If you came back and said that to me I wouldn’t be able to reciprocate. Like I had said, we were a perfect fit in some ways and not a fit in other. For things that are important to me in my life right now, I am not able to fit you in. And you deserve to be treated better and with more love. That is why I absolutely believe that I did the right thing by disappearing on you. Subjective and highly debatable. Sure.
I hope you are well baby (tears are rolling down just saying that word). Except an occasional reference I have not said that to anyone in such a long time. I miss saying that to you! You were such a joy! For this moment right now, I would give up everything to be with you. I miss you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, whenever I think about this topic of what role I have ended playing in the life of someone I genuinely cared about so much, the only rationalisation I have found for myself (mostly so that I can sleep peacefully at night) is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is ok to disappoint others if it means not disappointing yourself</p>

There was no plan to get out of the bed except the untimely work event that presented itself. That definitely got me moving but with a heavy heart and drudgingly slow mind.</p>

<p>Since then I have navigated my day with immense resistence. Feeling low and discouraged, I have been asking myself is this what rest of my life is going to be like? What can I do to change it?</p>

<p>How can I find contentment and peace, that eschews me so boldly? Do I need friends, do I need solitude, do I need purpose, do I need love, do I need people, do I need family, or do I just need to go back in time? Where did I cross over into this swamp of quicksand, where it takes immense effort to brave each day?</p>

<p>Sometimes I need a fresh start. Like, I need to be reborn. With new frame of mind, no baggage of the past, nothing to pull me down. And I need nourishment of love. But what is that love? Is it someone sitting next to me holding me? Is it physical? Is it someone just thinking about me? Is it someone who just cares about it? What is this elusive love that I keep looking for? How can I define it?</p>

<p>Just these questions ricocheting in my mind like a loose bullet. Everytime they hit a wall, it chips away a part of it. Overtime dismantling my sanity and I grow more and more frustrated with this lack of control on my life and my mind.</p>

<p>I want to go with the flow. But the flow won’t go with me. It is leaving me behind. Stranded and alone. I don’t think there is hope for me.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I woke up with a numb mind.

Was travelling for work and returning to home in cab. Cab rides, remind me of me talking to her. The long chats we use to have and the frivilous things we use to say. The tired mind and lonely soul got sucked into the whirlwhind of memories.</p>

<p>In that moment, my mind was swirling with emotions. I felt reaching out and talking to her. Expressing how I was feeling. Contradictions were all over were me. I realized that I needed to let it all out but not at the cost of her or my sanity.</p>

<p>I figured for someone who has blocked me and cannot unblock me now, my letters would never be delivered to her. So I took a leap of faith and poured my heart out to her. Bared my soul into a letter. I shot it across into a void. Trembling with anxiety what if she read it? What if she received it?</p>

<p>Thankfully, atleast I think she did not, and it sits there in void. Capturing that moment of hopelessness for me. I can go back and read it. It was like capturing my emotions in a glass bottle and locking them away. Only to be admired momentarily every now and then.</p>

<p>I feel lighter having said everything that I wanted to. I feel happy to be able to say it to her and yet not to her. This is the best compromise I could have asked for. I don’t feel guilty, I don’t feel constrained.</p>

<p>I feel liberated, with a pseudo-void in my life, that is her. I don’t know how long this will last, but it works for now and that is more than what I can ask for. One step at a time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was sleep deprived for last few days. Was travelling for work and returning to home in cab.

I got up to help him and after helping him I found myself unable to go back to sleep. I ended up doomscrolling as usual.</p>

<p>Came across a song used as a background score by one of the videos on social media. It was a Tamil song by Iliayaaraja. This reminded me of a song that she once shared she me as one of her favourites. Unfortunately I didn’t remember the name or anything else about the song except a little context of what it was about. Thanks to the modern technology and its ability to deal with fuzzy asks, I was able to eventually find it. It was a song by Yesudas.</p>

<p>Since then the tune for both songs is stuck in my head reminding me of the long morning chats in general, over the phone before getting up. De-compressing and starting day with a conversation made mornings worth looking forward to. It has been so long that I have had a chat like that with anyone. These songs remind me of those rituals and her. Few days back I dreamt of her. I don’t remember the specifics but it was something in the context of her being indifferent to me on an airport.</p>

<p>It is funny how so many memories of her are all tied to travel, flights and airports and yet we were on an airport together maybe only once. And I remember that particular instance ended in both of us being distraught and sad. I am just glad we are not doing that to each other anymore. I continue to believe, this path has given certainty, closure and ability to move forward. Hopefully towards peace and maybe solitude.</p>

<p>One of the things a friend recently said, that helped me articulate it in a way, that I felt more at peace with it is</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Solitude is chosen, loneliness is not
~ A Friend</p>

I understand I forced that upon us, so it is understandable there must be some resentment to it. I can also imagine her saying something like “<i>I won’t give anyone else in my life this much power to have that level of control on me</i>”, but I believe, the process must have required getting as far away from me as possible. I have an appreciation of it and some perspective. So nothing is shocking here.</p>

<p>We corresponded as friends for 2 years or more maybe. There were treasure trove of letters we wrote. So many things, that I visit almost everyday to just read and smile. And no matter where and how I am, I don’t have it in me to delete those.</p>

<p>I tried to contact her recently through a letter to just see if we could catch up in person over a tea to see how we have been doing. Satiate the curiosity that hits wall everyday. But what I ended up realizing is that I think she has deleted me as a friend and all the correspondence that we ever had. The fact that she deleted me is understandable, but how did she muster the will power to delete those letters. Those are some last remanents of something that was so beautiful and pure. It was honest and it was just us.</p>

<p>It made me a bit sad. But I have no qualms about it. I understand that maybe that is what was needed for her to grieve, as I have needed those letters to manage my own process through all this time.</p>

<p>But one thing that I often think about is, what Dickens posed so beautifully as a question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I know my answer. I didn’t realize hers would  be so different.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have parted ways for a while now.

I had a neighbour when I was growing up. Someone of my mother’s age. I remember, every night she would howl as her drunk husband would beat her up. Year after year, life delivered pain and anguish. Many years later when I had moved away from that place, I found out that in an <s>un</s>fortunate accident her drunk husband fell from a height and passed away while he was visitng someone. She had a son, and she pegged her hopes on him to reclaim a life that never was.</p>

<p>Son got married, got hooked onto drugs. Wife left him and the son beat his mother for money, who had remained the sole bread winner <s>for the family</s>. The son was almost always absent into oblivion.</p>

<p>Few months ago, due to a municipal mishap she consumed contaminated water. Misread her medication and consumed it such that all her organs failed slowly while her son was no where to be seen. She battled slow death on her own in the slient corners of the humble abode that she had.</p>

<p>Another life, scarred, forgotten and uncared for. I was not particularly close to her. But when I heard this I felt extreme sadness. I felt like there is no one to remember her, everyone failed her. Every single person in her life. She was probably one person who could truly empathize with my mother when she had her own struggles. I don’t know for sure, but I know they shared some friendship and maybe the common ground for them was to be the women, whose life became all about being a caregiver to able and disabled bodied men.</p>

<p>So here I am remembering her to tell myself, that someone is thinking about her. Her life mattered in whatever little ways it did. Maybe it chisled a part of who I am.  I find it utterly depressing to accept that so much struggle for so little in life. <b>The life that wasn’t</b></p>

<p>I hope there were moments in your life that were happy and hopeful. And you are finally in a happy place, among people who only have love for you.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s post is about someone, whom I had not known or not kept in touch with.
