    <div class="post-body">
        <p>A Magpie sat huddled on a trembling twig,<br />
its eyes flickering like candlelight—<br />
darting here, glancing there,<br />
at everything and nothing at once.<br />
Was it lonely? Or merely lost in thought?<br />
Who is to say what stirs in a bird’s heart?<br /></p>

<p>Then the morning sun shifted,<br />
and a sudden gleam pierced the air—<br />
a shimmer, a whisper,<br />
a trinket glistening on the ground below.<br />
It called to the Magpie,<br />
softly, sweetly,<br />
like a secret meant only for two.<br /></p>

<p>“But I already have so many trinkets,” murmured the mind.<br />
“None like this,” sang the heart.<br />
And with a flutter of wings,<br />
it was gone—<br />
downward, chasing wonder.<br /></p>

<p>It pecked, prodded, pondered—<br />
evaluating, hesitating,<br />
and then surrendering—<br />
falling, without knowing,<br />
into that tender illusion we call love.<br /></p>

<p>“I need this,” it cried.<br />
“This one belongs to me!<br />
My life is hollow without it.”<br />
So it clutched the treasure in its beak<br />
and soared towards its nest—<br />
only to find there was no room.<br />
No matter how it tried,<br />
the trinket would not fit<br />
among the others it once adored.<br /></p>

<p>It perched nearby, still and aching,<br />
watching light dance across the thing<br />
it could not keep.<br />
And with a sigh—<br />
it let go.<br /></p>

<p>Now it sits in its nest,<br />
day after day,<br />
looking down at that trinket,<br />
glistening still,<br />
so close,<br />
so far.<br /></p>

<p>“Foolish Magpie,” they say,<br />
“forever chasing shiny dreams,<br />
mistaking fascination for love.”<br />
But what do they know—<br />
of longing feathered and fragile,<br />
of the shimmer that stirs a soul awake?<br /></p>

<p>Would a Magpie untouched by love<br />
still dream of a trinket it cannot hold?<br />
Would it question the comfort of its nest,<br />
its own safe cage of plenty?<br />
Perhaps they are right—<br />
perhaps Magpies are meant to be silly,<br />
to love what they cannot keep,<br />
to ache for the impossible.<br /></p>

<p>And one day—<br />
when it wakes to find<br />
the trinket gone,<br />
stolen by time or by wind—<br />
that will be the day<br />
it will finally know.<br /></p>

<p>Whether it was love,<br />
or merely light.<br /></p>
