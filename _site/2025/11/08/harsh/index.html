        <p>That was just unneccessarily harsh. Felt bad in the morning and I don’t even know why I said all of it.</p>

<p>None of that really was feedback, none of it was ever a problem. It was just plain nit-picking. I was lying in bed and reflecting, why am I nit-picking about her to myself?</p>

<p>It is just that she has moved on and living her life, and here I am still here trying to move past all of it, in some ways; tugging at old threads that keep coming out.</p>

<p>I wish I would get on already and live my life and focus on things that matter today. I think this was just a subconscious attempt to brew a mental distance from an idea and a memory.</p>

<p>It is not fair or real. But there must be a better way to do this. I am sure, I’ll figure it out, eventually. Until then, I hope she is well and happy. I hope she has forgotten about this place and she never finds that entry. Even if she ever does…</p>
