        <p>Back in cab, on my way to home. Reading old letters as I usually do at 1:30 am. Went far back when we were guessing names. I looked through the letters and I saw something that I missed as it was happening then.</p>

<p>Lookng back, I think this picture was the genesis of what we termed as “crash &amp; burn” eventually, even before it happened, from what <s>was</s> <i>could have been</i> a beautiful friendship.</p>

<p>The need to know more. The need to have more. The need to be more.</p>

<p>Once of the excerpt from the letter that I enjoyed reading again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have graduated to life, my dear! (I have this habit of kissing the back of my right fist when I think about/talk to myself about someone who I have tender feelings for – only a couple of people in that list– I just did that writing the above sentence. That’s the sign)</p>
