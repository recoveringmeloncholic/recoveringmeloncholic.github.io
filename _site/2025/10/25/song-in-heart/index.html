        <p>The sensor bell for his movement went off in the wee hours of the morning. I got up to help him and after helping him I found myself unable to go back to sleep. I ended up doomscrolling as usual.</p>

<p>Came across a song used as a background score by one of the videos on social media. It was a Tamil song by Iliayaaraja. This reminded me of a song that she once shared she me as one of her favourites. Unfortunately I didn’t remember the name or anything else about the song except a little context of what it was about. Thanks to the modern technology and its ability to deal with fuzzy asks, I was able to eventually find it. It was a song by Yesudas.</p>

<p>Since then the tune for both songs is stuck in my head reminding me of the long morning chats in general, over the phone before getting up. De-compressing and starting day with a conversation made mornings worth looking forward to. It has been so long that I have had a chat like that with anyone. These songs remind me of those rituals and her. Few days back I dreamt of her. I don’t remember the specifics but it was something in the context of her being indifferent to me on an airport.</p>

<p>It is funny how so many memories of her are all tied to travel, flights and airports and yet we were on an airport together maybe only once. And I remember that particular instance ended in both of us being distraught and sad. I am just glad we are not doing that to each other anymore. I continue to believe, this path has given certainty, closure and ability to move forward. Hopefully towards peace and maybe solitude.</p>

<p>One of the things a friend recently said, that helped me articulate it in a way, that I felt more at peace with it is</p>

  <p>Solitude is chosen, loneliness is not
~ A Friend</p>
