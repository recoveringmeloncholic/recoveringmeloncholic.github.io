        <p>There was always a certain inequality in the relationship. In my attempt to be a glassfrog I have created an inlet for the others to peep-in without being offered that luxury in return. Second guessing how someone I care about is doing, is hard. I end up projecting my current mood. Which can vary wildly with the time of the day. In absence of knowledge I assume the worst and do what I think I must.</p>

<p>Do I have the right to feel upset about the fact that someone has access to what I am thinking when I have chosen to put it out in the public domain? Is it fair to expect similar access to the most intimate thoughts in return? I don’t think so. That’s not how the realm of internet works. You write something and it is for the world to consume. You want something truly private then you ring-fence it with everything you can.</p>

<p>So now I am wondering, where does all of this lie? Is it personal and to be guarded or is it public and I should not fret about it. I have never censored what I have to say in the past.  But then I have also not had a situation where the subject of the writing has been a spectator and reader as well.</p>

<p>Now I have accountability for what I say. These words are not just words anymore. They have power to hurt and be consequential. They represent a version of truth. And they are irreversible.</p>

<p>Has this place outgrown its purpose? Or is it time for it to be a private journal for just my consumption, forever; despite the fact that lot of people have signed up to read it in last few weeks? Or should I be indifferent to how these words affect someone?</p>

<p>A question that is possibly better answered in the waking moments of a morning than the drowning darkness of the setting night.</p>
