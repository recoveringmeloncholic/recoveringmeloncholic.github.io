        <p>I am surprisingly devoid of emotions this morning. I imagined my body would refuse to get out of the bed today. But I did and made tea for dad. I am going to get into a shower. It feels like my mind is actively trying to partition my life. The one on the weekend, where a sadness washes over me and the one on the weekday, where it tries to stay focused and dispassionate.</p>

<p>I have mountain of work in front of me. I know there will be moments and I know I am grieving somewhere deep down. But right now, it feels like my mind and body are acclimatising to help me move without compromising my day to day sanity. This feel weird</p>

<p>I have set myself back on my weight and gained enough in short amount of time. But it is ok. I will not exert too much control on myself will just continue healthy eating for this week and hopefully I’ll be back on track.</p>

<p>So today is just empty. There is no sadness, no rage, no joy. I feel like a boulder, sitting in one place, weathering whatever time will bring. Just being stoic.</p>
