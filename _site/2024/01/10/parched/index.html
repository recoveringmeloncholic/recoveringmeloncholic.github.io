        <p>I am craving a drink. To drown these feelings and the loneliness that night brings everyday. Acutely aware that this is where path to self destruction begins.</p>

<p>I can taste it on my tongue, feel it dull my senses and relieve this ache that perennially plagues me. She won’t approve. But if she had a say in it then it would also be redundant.</p>

<p>I know I’ll possibly be blamed for the circumstances. Thats fine. I don’t mind accountability of my actions. I know why I am here. It may look like a maze of decisions, but the path I was on, was always going to lead me here. One way or another. I know it.</p>

<p>The taste of elixir on the tongue, the numbness that you immediately feel. A spiced concoction with an icy cold texture. Swirling in your mouth before it traverses down your body diffusing itself into the bloodstream. The mind slows down, the time speeds up. And a senile smile takes over parched lips. It sits with you in this dark corner like a loyal companion who will whisper in ear all these things that a sober mind is unable to conjure.</p>

<p>I am romanticising my tete-e-tete with a glass of whiskey. It seems to be calling me. The question is whether I’ll answer.</p>

<p>Only tomorrow will tell.</p>
