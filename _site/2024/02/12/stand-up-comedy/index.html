        <p>I just dreamt about her whole night. The one I saw in the early hours stuck with me among the different ones that I saw.</p>

<p>I was living in London in the house that we use to live in. She sent me a stand-up comedy show link in a message. It was at 9 pm. I took bicycle to the show. Reached the place, it was a library. I was looking for her but couldn’t spot her. Messaged her to check where she was and she replied I should look for UAE flag section. I spot her sitting and sit next to her. Happy to see her finally. After few minutes she asked me if I could sit a few seats away as her Date was also on the way and will be there soon. I was thrown back and asked her why did you ask me to come if you were on a date? She responded that the message was just to share the fact that there was a show, not an invitation.</p>

<p>I sat there thinking for few minutes about what was I to do knowing there was a stand up comedy in the city if not come. But she was right, in my anxiousness to see her, I overlooked the fact that she’d didn’t ask me to come. Anyway, I got up to leave and she asked me where I was going? I said, to find some snacks and will be back later. She says there are no food counters here. Told her it didn’t matter, I was going to leave as there has been enough comedy of errors for one evening. I was just being polite about it.</p>

<p>And that was that. What hurt me most after getting up from the dream was that I can’t picture her face. I is getting hazy in my dreams. That just makes me sad.</p>
