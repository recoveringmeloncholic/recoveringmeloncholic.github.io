        <p>I was going about my business as usual. Mind galloping through the fields of memories and then suddenly I stumbled on this realisation that talking to myself constantly in my head was such a usual part of my life for so many years. The anxiety to tell or share something with a real person didn’t even exist. My usual routine was to do celebratory cheers and sullen whispers in my head and move on.</p>

<p>Last few months had completely changed that. I had a totally different outlet. I was talking to a real person. Looking forward to it. Instead of listening to music in my car, I would be debating, learning, arguing or laughing about something or the other. I am back to the music, the loud volume trying to drown the thoughts in my head. I am talking to myself once again. It doesn’t feel unnatural but something feels amiss. It happened without any warning, in a split second as if a tsunami of thought released a feeling that was deeply buried somewhere inside and the emotions ran unchecked. Took me a bit to recover but I did. Rest of the day went running post to post. No time to breath.</p>

<p>I am lying in the bed now and out of nowhere comes this deep sense of loss of friendship and loneliness. And I am back in the emotional trenches. These emotions come as aftershocks.</p>

<p>They are sudden, come without a warning and take over me rapidly. I am trying but I don’t think I can replicate how I felt again. And some part of me is even scared to do that. There is only so many times you want to give these jolts of change to yourself.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the aftershocks will pass and I will be a person I was. Cruising an unexhilarating life on auto pilot, living and subtitling it in my head, as I would have a year ago.</p>

<p>Alone was never this hard before.</p>
