        <p>What am I supposed to say? How am I to respond to something heartfelt? You can’t be the one to put up a wall and then pretend that it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>The words clamber to the tip of my tongue to die there. They lie among the things unsaid. Possibly for the best. Short term vs long term trade offs, right? Where does this path go? Do we need to walk this? Do we even have a choice?</p>

<p>Sometimes, we simplify the choices that we have, we reduce the arguments we face, we answer simply in our minds, sidelining the nuances, possibilities and complexities. We want decisions to be taken away from us. And be made bystanders to our lives so that we don’t remain answerable to our future self.</p>

<p>How do we we get past this place? How do we both find peace?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chasm that divides us<br />
one that grows bigger by the day<br />
is too big for words to bridge now<br />
no matter what we have to say<br />
<br />
the burden that is ours to carry<br />
despondency that precipitates these sighs<br />
before we crumble under its weight<br />
our hearts of steel must say their goodbyes<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has to be a way.</p>
