        <p>It was the end of the road for her. She had known that for a while, I knew it only in that moment. She had slipped away and continued to go further with every passing moment. The machines continued to whirr and beep. The mouth lay half open and eyes shut. Chest rising and falling down as air continued to flush her lungs. I wasn’t sure if she could hear me. In that moment I decided that I didn’t not want to regret never having said those words to her while I still had the chance.</p>

<p>I told her that I was sorry for everything that happened in her life. The fact that she fought for her kids relentlessly. She was the strongest person I knew. I was sorry that things didn’t turn out how she wanted them to. That I loved her and was going to miss her. And that kids would miss her terribly. And that I am here with her.</p>

<p>I held her hand and kissed her on her forehead. This was the most affection I had shown her in decades. And I only hoped that moment, she could hear me and feel me.</p>

<p>I miss you. I hope you are at peace finally.</p>
