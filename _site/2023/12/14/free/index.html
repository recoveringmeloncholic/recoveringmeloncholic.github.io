  <p>The space that separates us<br />
space that surrounds me<br />
has me huddled in a corner<br />
when it was suppose to set me free<br /></p>

  <p>Battling against my own thoughts<br />
mind attempting to deceive and delude me<br />
with its intricately crafted constraints<br />
when it was suppose to set me free<br /></p>

  <p>Questioning choices, after I made them<br />
is this what I imagined this to be<br />
my choices that chain me right now<br />
when they were suppose to set me free<br /></p>

  <p>Having inflicted pain &amp; agony on self<br />
pushing people away from me<br />
resigned, I wait eternally to be rescued<br />
knowing, now only she can set me free<br /></p>
