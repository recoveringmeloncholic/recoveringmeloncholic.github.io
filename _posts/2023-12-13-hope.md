Today morning it just hit me how little control I have on my life. An uninterrupted sleep through the night was something I took for granted for so long. Sometimes I wish, I could abandon everyone & everything around me and be gone for a while. Unfortunately I am not sure, what kind of person I would have to be, to ever be able to do that.

All I know that on some days the uncertainty and lack of control seems more prominent than maybe it really is. Despite all the support I have from everyone around me, I feel alone, exhausted and trapped in my life.

I know there will be better days. I just need to get through today. No matter how many times I am told that I am not alone in this, the reality is that I am.
