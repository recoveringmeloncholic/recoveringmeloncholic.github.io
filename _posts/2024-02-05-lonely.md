There are so many times when I wished that I would  somehow get away from everything and everyone and no one is able to find me. But it mostly remained a momentary wish. Something you say but don't really realise or experience. This time however I may have ventured far away from everything. There is truly no one who is going to find me here. Finally I am alone with myself. No matter how loud I scream, what I say, it is going to go unheard and be lost into the void.

Even though earlier I was mostly talking to myself all this while, there was some solace that someone else was listening in on it. Not anymore.

It feels a bit lonlier than it did before. Nothing that I can't survive though. Right?
