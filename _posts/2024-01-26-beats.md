I lie in this bed unable to walk. And a single song runs on a loop. She asked me if the songs with faster beats make me feel better?

In reality, beats just drown the thoughts out. They make it easy to release the pent up emotions. Beats take the focus away from the tears running down the face to agreeable head shaking that fools the mind into thinking that my body is somehow feeling different than my heart.

And so tonight is owned by this song that is underpinned by beats and tempo. While my mind is navigating the noise of memories.
