I didn't know until then, that a calm breeze & setting sun could be so peaceful.  It fed the souls, calmed the mind and melted the hearts. Despite the fact that nothing was said, it was one of the memorable evenings I have. The place is etched with a memory that time will find hard to scrub.

With the drowning sun, drowned so many choices & possibilities and all that remained behind were memories that I'll cling onto forever. It is surprising how some of the most mediocre coffee can become a cherished memory.

It'll be one of my favorite spots and now I know where to go when I am lost.

I am glad, it happened. I am glad everything led to where I found myself and I am thankful that I got this day.
