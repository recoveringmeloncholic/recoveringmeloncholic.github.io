>Nobody heard him, the dead man,<br/>
>But still he lay moaning:<br/>
>I was much further out than you thought<br/>
>And not waving but drowning.<br/>
>Poor chap, he always loved larking<br/>
>And now he's dead<br/>
>It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,<br/>
>They said.<br/>
>Oh, no no no, it was too cold always<br/>
>(Still the dead one lay moaning)<br/>
>I was much too far out all my life<br/>
>And not waving but drowning.<br/>
