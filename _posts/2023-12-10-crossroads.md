As the rubber hits the tarmac, I am no more in transit. I am supposed to be home now. The consequences of my decisions is reality of my life now. I have chosen a path and I must go down that path.

As I leave the cross roads behind with supposedly having made a decision, why do I still feel so lost. They said irreversible decisions and paths make life simpler. Then why is my heart heavier and gloom thicker. I thought this was going to feel better, but it doesn't.

What am I doing?
