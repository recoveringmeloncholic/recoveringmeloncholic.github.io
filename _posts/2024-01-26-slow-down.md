There is nowhere I need to be. There is no one waiting for me. There is nothing I hope to accomplish in specific. There is nothing waiting to happen. There is no rush. Time and the need to make best of it is illusionary. The moment is now, I am here, all I need is around me. I need to pause and appreciate this and now.

Slow down.
