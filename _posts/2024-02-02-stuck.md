Sometimes I wonder if she remembers me still. The fast fading memory of a time and person that was transitory and ephemeral. Maybe one day she will wake up and the  day will pass in pre occupation of things and people that matter more and reside in the mental space that I once claimed. Not anymore. I will be an after thought. Unintentional and unexpected.

Days, weeks and months will pass with a feeble recollection of those moments. Debating the accuracy of what really happened, if it did at all.  Maybe laughing on the silliness of it all.

While I sink deeper into this marsh and  quicksand of memories. Reliving and drowning into those moments, as if they occurred last night. Stuck in time, stuck in this loop. Unable to get out.
