A Magpie sat huddled on a trembling twig,<br/>
its eyes flickering like candlelight—<br/>
darting here, glancing there,<br/>
at everything and nothing at once.<br/>
Was it lonely? Or merely lost in thought?<br/>
Who is to say what stirs in a bird’s heart?<br/>

Then the morning sun shifted,<br/>
and a sudden gleam pierced the air—<br/>
a shimmer, a whisper,<br/>
a trinket glistening on the ground below.<br/>
It called to the Magpie,<br/>
softly, sweetly,<br/>
like a secret meant only for two.<br/>

“But I already have so many trinkets,” murmured the mind.<br/>
“None like this,” sang the heart.<br/>
And with a flutter of wings,<br/>
it was gone—<br/>
downward, chasing wonder.<br/>

It pecked, prodded, pondered—<br/>
evaluating, hesitating,<br/>
and then surrendering—<br/>
falling, without knowing,<br/>
into that tender illusion we call love.<br/>

“I need this,” it cried.<br/>
“This one belongs to me!<br/>
My life is hollow without it.”<br/>
So it clutched the treasure in its beak<br/>
and soared towards its nest—<br/>
only to find there was no room.<br/>
No matter how it tried,<br/>
the trinket would not fit<br/>
among the others it once adored.<br/>

It perched nearby, still and aching,<br/>
watching light dance across the thing<br/>
it could not keep.<br/>
And with a sigh—<br/>
it let go.<br/>

Now it sits in its nest,<br/>
day after day,<br/>
looking down at that trinket,<br/>
glistening still,<br/>
so close,<br/>
so far.<br/>

“Foolish Magpie,” they say,<br/>
“forever chasing shiny dreams,<br/>
mistaking fascination for love.”<br/>
But what do they know—<br/>
of longing feathered and fragile,<br/>
of the shimmer that stirs a soul awake?<br/>

Would a Magpie untouched by love<br/>
still dream of a trinket it cannot hold?<br/>
Would it question the comfort of its nest,<br/>
its own safe cage of plenty?<br/>
Perhaps they are right—<br/>
perhaps Magpies are meant to be silly,<br/>
to love what they cannot keep,<br/>
to ache for the impossible.<br/>

And one day—<br/>
when it wakes to find<br/>
the trinket gone,<br/>
stolen by time or by wind—<br/>
that will be the day<br/>
it will finally know.<br/>

Whether it was love,<br/>
or merely light.<br/>
