Most days when I am down in the dumps I use this place to find my balance, vent out and generally spew hatred at the cosmos. However the days I am at peace, I tend to be an ungrateful prick and I don't say much. So I thought maybe it is time to change it today.

While I am not at a point where I am thinking of this as a gratitude journal, even though I have enough in life to be grateful about, I think it is worth broadcasting to the void that I feel hopeful, calm and content. 

Last few days were all about regurgigating months of pent up feelings. With all that unloaded into the abyss, I feel lighter and calmer. 

It is easy to get tunnel-visioned on what you don't have, to lose the sight of what you do. I remember I took this path to make best of what I have rather than what it could be. Today is a reminder of that.
