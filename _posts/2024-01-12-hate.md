I am sooooo out there, no sense of reality around me. I keep checking my messages, but they don't come.

I am watching intersteller. I am at 1:20:11 in the movie. 23 years have passed and all these messages are going into the oblivion. And then at 1:27:17 I broke down again. It just felt like no one out there is listening to me. I know it is because I have put  a password to this site. It is just your fucking name!

It is not your fault. It just feels like no one came looking for me. Trying hard enough. Mostly because I am not worth it but primarily because I think because I have been drinking for 5 hours now. I am tired.

I am too exhausted to even hate anyone. Just let me be and leave me be.
