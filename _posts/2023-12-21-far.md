We could have been hugging each other, but for the first time I felt the distance that I have not felt before. Felt incredibly alone. With everything that has happened in last few weeks, it feels like I am actively working on isolating myself day after day. Exhausting people around me.

I keep telling myself that I have hit the rock bottom. But I am also worried that my downhill journey is just getting started and worst is yet to come.

I just hope that when my breaking point comes and my sanity is dismantled, everyone I have ever loved, is far away from me. And hopefully then a question that was asked philosophically will become my reality.

I will pass into oblivion and no one will know. It is both calming and depressing. But thats ok.
