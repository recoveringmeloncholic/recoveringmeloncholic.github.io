It feels like I am embarking on this steep climb ahead of me, alone. It is dark and desolated. There is haunting music echoing around. Every time I wish for company of people who should be here with me, my mind cautions me against that. It reminds me the agony and angst it will bring and that I am better off alone. It feels like a conditioning exercise. Where the residual pain in my heart is guiding my mind and my survival instincts to kick in. All they are doing is making me even more of a recluse than I was before.

But the quiet around me is unbearable. Earlier my nights slipped away unknowingly every day, and now I have to work hard for each passing second. What happened? How did I get to this point? Will I ever get out of this emotional maze?

A simple message sent into void is giving me so much heartache. I have this perpetual ache in center of my chest.

Today I am in broken in pieces. But I know people who love me would want me to gather myself and put it all back together. So as much as I hate it, thats what I am going to do. My rescuer today is music and I'll cling to it until I fall asleep.
