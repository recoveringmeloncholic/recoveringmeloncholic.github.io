Lost in a sea of people, I go where my steps take me. Huddled between strangers, miles above the ocean, there is nowhere I need to be. On a journey with no destination in sight, I dwell in these dark places, far away from light. I wish I was just simply lost, waiting to find my way out of these woods. But to be lost there needs to be a place where I want to be. But there isn't.
