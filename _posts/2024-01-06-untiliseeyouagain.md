Just typing that title broke me down. I looked at myself in the mirror and questioned if it really mattered how I looked. Why do I care? No one else does. It may not be true, but in some ways it is.

I have been rope walking for last 5 days. It is time I let myself fall and splatter on the ground. Once I have been down and out for long enough, maybe I'll be able to gather myself up and feel normal again.

And when I am resurrected, I'll repeat. Until it stops hurting.

If you wonder what's going on with me?
