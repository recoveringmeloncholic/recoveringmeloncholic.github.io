It is like a habit, just going back to the same place again and again to see if there is a message. Knowing very well that there might not be one. And when there isn't one, I try not to take it personally. Afterall this is what I asked for.

And yet, is it not ok to hope against hope and to be little bit unreasonable with youself sometimes? Can you not want everything in life, even if only for a split second? Do I really have to be practical, realistic and grounded?

What matters is that the joy of a single unexpected tiny monosyllable can diminish the disappointment of thousand tries.
