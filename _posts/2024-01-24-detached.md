I have been wondering if a sudden lack of emotional response healthy, normal or expected? Or my mind is just taking a break. I feel unaffected by everything. I feel like I am running on auto pilot. There is this sudden emotional lull.

I had an overwhelming emotional week and now all I hear in my head is, quiet. I don't feel sad, or relieved or happy.

Lying here, listening to music, eyes closed, my mind feels like a mill that has suddenly stopped after an eternity and the ambient noise that I got so used to has been replaced by this eerie silence that I find extremely uncomfortable. And I am both missing and dreading the constant churning of thoughts and emotions that rocked me to sleep every night
