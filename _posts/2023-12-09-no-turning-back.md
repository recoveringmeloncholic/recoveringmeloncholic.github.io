I am sitting here, my back squeezing the pillow into the wall. I close my eyes, and I am transported to your living room. Giggling and lazing around on the red floor. Nothing else mattered. I have never looked at someone when I kissed them. But I looked at you. And you were looking back into my soul, measuring how much I wanted you. That moment, when you know nothing could push us apart. And yet, life finds a way.
