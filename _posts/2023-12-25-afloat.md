Today I have run out of music and I dwell in my dreams. Keeping the eyes shut. Listening noise to crowd the mind with thoughts and empty the heart of feelings. It may not look healthy but it is simpler. The pillow I cling to is my buoy today. Giving me the hugs I desperately need and keeping me afloat from drowning in the turbulent sea of my emotions. I am not even looking for shores. Just need a break from deciding what to do next. Watch the sky and stars above me and just be. I know I need to swim myself out of here. But that I can do tomorrow when I the sun rises again. Today is all about staying afloat and staying put.
