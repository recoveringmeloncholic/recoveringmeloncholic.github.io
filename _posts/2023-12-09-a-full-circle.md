Months ago, I was in this city, fervently typing my heart out to you. It is a bit ironical that my next trip here has concluded our time together. Almost as if our life together has come a full circle.

We were here for a reason and a season. Our purpose for each other has been met, maybe. It is a bit hard to accept that. Our absence from each other's life needs the support that our presence had become.

I just hope, we find our way out of the woods without getting lost.
