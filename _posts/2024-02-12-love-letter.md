Sometimes I wonder why do I write everything that I write here? And then I stumbled on a letter that Richard Feynman wrote to his wife 16 months after she died. And it reminded me that sometimes we write for ourselves and not others.

>I adore you, sweetheart.

>I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only >write it because you like it — I write it because it >makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.

>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you >— almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because >you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I >thought there was no sense to writing.
