It has been long. When I left this blog to wither and decay, I did not assume I would need to visit it back. For a time it was my primary outlet of emotions that I needed to regulate. Even though I am in a better place and more resilient, it is difficult to change who I am. I need an outlet to periodically express myself and let the festering emotions out. So I am here, raking and resurrecting this place once again.

I hope this is the quiet room I can reflect, introspect and regurgitate in, on days that I can somehow brave, but the nights that would otherwise defeat me
