I cannot let me go to sleep like that. It is 4 am. I need some courage and inspiration, so I am resorting to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lcGnMhvsA&ref=www.belligerent-buffoon.com" target="main">clip</a>. I'll attempt and dock to sanity. Not because it is possible, but because it is necessary.

If you understand this movie you know what this means. It is putting everything at stake. This is the last resort.

Hopefully we make it to the other side.
