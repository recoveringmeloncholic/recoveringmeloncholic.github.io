Love can overpower our sanity and reason. The ask to help replace the love you feel, sounds unreasonable and almost vengeful. Yet, I agreed, knowing that even the thought of seeing another person slowly inch into my place, is heart wrenching. It is an incredibly difficult position to be in. I know, I forced this situation on both of us and I need to take accountability for it. But the accountability shouldn't have to be in form of asks that requires you to hurt yourself with every passing second. I want both of us to survive and find our way. But I cannot be the guide for someone when I myself don't know where I am going.

I hope in my attempt to help find the way to address the guilt I carry, I don't end up losing myself completely.
