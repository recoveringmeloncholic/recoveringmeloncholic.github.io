Something to remember when you are lost in the darkness of the night.

>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br/>
>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br/>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br/>
>Because their words had forked no lightning they<br/>
>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
<br/>
>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br/>
>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br/>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br/>
>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br/>
>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
<br/>
>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br/>
>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br/>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br/>
>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br/>
>Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
