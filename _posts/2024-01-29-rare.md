>If we do not listen to our convictions, they might haunt us for rest of our lives.

I understand why everyone thinks I am hesitating to make the right choice. Why they think I am driven by fear. The problem is not that I am conservative or scared. The problem is that we are different people. What I believe, what I hold close to my heart and my definition of non-negotiable is fundamentally different. I am comfortable with the idea that my approach to life in general may not be right, but I am convinced about things I believe in. They sit well with me.

I am ok to deal with the heartache but I am also at peace knowing that I refused to give up on things that really matter to me. I find this unreasonable stubbornness comforting.

The only regret I have is that to achieve this level of conviction and clarity, I had to break trust, heart and promises.

Maybe what I lack in reason, I make up with the fierceness with which I am willing to fight and stick. My methods are unrealistic, thought process self-detrimental and temperament overly compensating.

But I hope my love is <u><b>rare</b></u>. And that's all that matters to me.
