I haven't been here in a while. It has been a conscious choice. I have held myself back largely. There are several unpublished drafts that I don't think I'll publish now. In fact, I have been thinking about taking down this blog for good. I think it has run its course and served its purpose, to whatever extent it possibly can. I have to pay some money to run it everyday. I anyway cannot do that indefinitely and I don't want to host it anywhere else.

I have mostly ok days. I am busy, occupied and going where my life will take me. Some parts have changed in my life, others I have made peace with. I do remain emotionally volatile and erupt now and then. But I hope thats almost like a volcano, possibly never going to go away only transition from active to dormant state. Thats life.

This is it, thanks for listening to me.
