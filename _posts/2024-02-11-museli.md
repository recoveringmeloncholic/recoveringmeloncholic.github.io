My emotions have been running unchecked for 2 days now. Leaking corners of eyes every few minutes. Three only thing I can do it look away and try and shut down my mind, distract it or play a game endlessly on my phone. And then as soon as I pause, all of it comes rushing back.

I am not sure what is causing it. But this is as bad it ever got. I am hoping it will pass.

I don't know how to reach out and say something, just to hear a response back. So I pinged to ask for museli recipe. 1 hour after I finished my Museli. As expected she replied earnestly. I don't even care for the recipe. I already know it. Simple words is what I was looking for. It made me feel better, atleast momentarily.

Just so I don't think about her, I finished 120 levels in a new game that I stared since last evening.

Hopefully this weekend will be over soon and I can go back to being miserable but atleast busy.
