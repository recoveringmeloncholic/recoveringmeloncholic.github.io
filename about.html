    <p>
        Hello, I'm a recovering melancholic navigating the complexities of modern life through writing, reflection, and continuous learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        This blog is my attempt to make sense of the world and my place in it. Through personal essays, book reflections, and thoughts on technology and society, I explore themes of meaning, purpose, and the human condition.

    <h2>Why "Recovering Melancholic"?</h2>

    <p>
        The term "recovering melancholic" reflects my ongoing journey with introspection, melancholy, and the search for meaning. Like recovery from anything, it's not about reaching a final destination, but about the continuous process of growth and self-understanding.

        I believe that by sharing our struggles and insights, we can help each other navigate the challenging terrain of being human in the 21st century.
